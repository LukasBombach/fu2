If you're using PostgreSQL you need to run "CREATE LANGUAGE 'plpgsql';" on each database first, this it required by ultrasphinx.

To deploy you need to create copies of the following files and remove the .sample extension:

- config/database.yml.sample
- config/deploy.rb.sample
- config/mongrel_cluster.yml.sample
