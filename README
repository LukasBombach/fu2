== About fu2

fu2 is a community-software. It works similar to forums, but also has some differences.

== Notes

If you're using PostgreSQL you need to run "CREATE LANGUAGE 'plpgsql';" on each database first, this it required by ultrasphinx.

To deploy you need to create copies of the following files and remove the .sample extension:

- config/database.yml.sample
- config/deploy.rb.sample
- config/mongrel_cluster.yml.sample
